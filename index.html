    <strong><h2>Bio</h2></strong>
    <p>My name is Christopher Janousek. I am a web development student currently at Code Fellows in Seattle, WA. I am originally from New Mexico but have also lived in Idaho, Colorado, Texas, Florida, and now Washington. I joined the military in November 2009 at around the height of the recession due to lack of options and completed my service commitment Nov 2015. I received an honorable discharge and quickly got a job at Boeing. Having worked there for a year I quickly realized that what I was doing wasn't what I wanted to spend the rest of my life doing. I checked out a Code Fellows 101 course and decided this may be a career I would be happy with.</p>
